We are researching about various topics related to multiphase flow and related flow assurance issues. Due to temparature and pressure change in subsea flowlines, hydrocarbon stream may experience solid deposition issues such as gas hydrate, wax and asphaltene. These solid deposition and prevention strateges must be studied together with multiphase-flow simulation and thermodynamic fluid characterization. 

Current research projects are focusing on two phase flow charactreristics in flowloop and hydrate risk management with under-inhibition of MEG.
